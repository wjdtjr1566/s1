        Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already <br>
         guested with US superstar Drake, was awarded best <br>
         contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-<br>
         hop track that criticises Theresa May over lack of NHS<br>
          funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and<br>
           more. The track also castigates David Cameron over Brexit<br>
            (“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line”)<br>
             and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective,<br>
              honest politician. <br>
One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her <br>
 handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster. </div>
 <div class="작은박스2">     Ed Sheeran was named songwriter of the year, but lost <br>
     the album prize to Stormzy, with another rapper, Dave, <br>
     winning best contemporary song for Question Time
